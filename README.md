# 💼 Employee Salary Prediction using Machine Learning

🚧 **This project is a work in progress.**  
So far: dataset loading, basic exploration, null value handling, outlier removal, and label encoding are done.  
Next: model training, evaluation, and optimization.

## 📌 Overview

This project was initiated as part of my AI internship with **Edunet Foundation** under the **IBM SkillsBuild Program (June–July 2025)**.

The goal is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether an individual's salary is above or below 50K based on demographic and work-related features.

## 🧠 What’s Done So Far

- ✅ Mounted Google Drive in Colab  
- ✅ Loaded and explored dataset  
- ✅ Handled missing values and unknowns (`?`)  
- ✅ Label encoded categorical features  
- ✅ Removed outliers in age  
- ✅ Performed basic visualizations (boxplot)

## 📊 Dataset Used

- Adapted version of the **UCI Adult Census Income** dataset  
- 48,842 rows, 15 columns (after cleaning)
